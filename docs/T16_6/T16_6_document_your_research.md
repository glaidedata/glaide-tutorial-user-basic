### Create a measurement entry

Similar to the examples given above, you can also create an entry using the built-in *Measurement ELN* schema for your measurements.

??? example "Example: Creating an entry for Optical Absorption Measurement (steps)"
    - Follow the steps for [creating an entry using NOMAD's Built-in Schema.](#create-an-entry-using-nomads-built-in-schema) and select *Measurement ELN* in step 3.
    - Use the referencing option to the existing entries, or create new entries to connect to your *Measurement ELN*, similar to the steps **13-17** and **31-36** in the [Built-in Schema for Material Processing](#built-in-schema-for-material-processing-eln).

??? info "Key input fields in *Measurement ELN*:"
    - Similar to other entries, we have **name**, **starting Time**, **ID**, **location**, **description**.
    - Subsections such as **steps**, **samples**, **instruments** used in measurement.


### Integrate your experiment

Once all substances, samples, processes, and measurements are defined, you can integrate them into a structured workflow using the *Experiment ELN* schema. The *Experiment ELN* schema allows linking **processes** and **measurements** into a single entry for a comprehensive overview of your experiment.

??? example "Example: Creating an Experiment ELN Entry (steps)"
    - Create an entry using the built-in **Experiment ELN** schema.
    - Provide a **name**, **description**, and link relevant **processes** and **measurements**.
    - Save the entry to establish a structured record of your experiment.
    Following, you see screensots of how your experiment entry and workflow graph will look like **after** you integrated your **processes** and **measurements** to your **experiment**.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/create_built-in_schema/steps2.gif" alt="create built-in schema" width="800">

## Exploring and Searching Entries in NOMAD’s ELN

??? example "Download the example file for this excercise"
    [Download example_NOMAD_ELN.zip](https://github.com/glaidedata/glaide-tutorial-user-basic/raw/refs/heads/main/tutorial_16_materials/part_4_files/example_NOMAD_ELN.zip){:target="_blank" .md-button}

    The file contains multiple NOMAD ELN entries in `.json` format.

    These entries have been created using the NOMAD ELN built-in schema, organized into folders, and categorized with custom tags.

    You can drag and drop this file into a new upload in NOMAD to view its contents.

Imagine you have created multiple entries of substances, samples, instruments, processes, and measurements, and you need to quickly find a specific experiment or material. Instead of manually searching through files, NOMAD’s ELN allows you to search, filter, and organize your entries—saving you time and effort.

??? info "Organizing your ELN upload"
    NOMAD is a file-based system. You can access, organize, and download your files within each upload. You can also create folders to categorize entries into materials, samples, instruments, processes, and results, as well as upload additional documents, such as relevant PDFs.

    !!! warning "If you plan to organize your entries into separate folders, do so before you reference them to each other. Moving them afterward may break the reference links."

    You can follow these steps to organize your ELN entries:

    1. Navigate to the **FILES** tab in your upload. This view functions like a file explorer, allowing you to view and manage files.
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/organization/files_explorer_in_NOMAD.png" alt="interactive workflow gif" width="400">
    </div>

    2. Add new folders and organize them according to your needs.
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/creating_new_folders.gif" alt="interactive workflow gif" width="400">
    </div>

    3. Drag and drop files into the desired folder. A prompt will appear, asking if you want to copy or move the files—choose according to your needs.
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/moving_files_to_a_folder.gif" alt="interactive workflow gif" width="400">
    </div>

    4. Once all files are sorted, take a moment to review the structure. Here’s an example of an organized ELN
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/after_organization.png" alt="interactive workflow gif" width="400">
    </div>

**Searching your ELN entries**

To search for entries in your ELN, follow these steps:

1. on the top of the ELN upload page, click on the <img src="images/organization/icon_search_upload.png" alt="Search ELN icon" width="20"> icon.

    ![screenshot of step 1](images/organization/explore_ELN_step_1.png)

2. From the drop-down menu, select *Entries*.

    ![screenshot of step 2](images/organization/explore_ELN_step_2.png)

    This will open NOMAD's **EXPLORE** page with a filter applied to display only the entries from your upload.

    ![screenshot of NOMAD EXPLORE page wiht the filter applied](images/organization/explore_ELN_step_2r.png)

On the **EXPLORE** page, you can use the filter options in the sidebar to refine your search, enter specific keywords in the search bar to find relevant entries, or create custom widgets to visualise your ELN data.

??? info "Filtering entries in NOMAD"
    NOMAD provides various filters that can be used to efficiently find your ELN entries, but the following two filters are particularlly effective:

    - Filter by built-in schema used to create the entry.

        *For example, ELNInstrument, ELNSubstances, ELNSample, etc.*

    - Filter by custom tags, where you assign common tags to related entries for easy grouping.

        *For example, tag all solvents as "my_solvent" or all samples as "my_samples".*

    Using these filters helps you quickly locate specific entries in your ELN.

**Customize your search interface with widgets**

Widgets allow you to customize your search interface to better suit your data exploration needs. By adding and rearranging widgets, you can create a personalized view that highlights the most relevant filters, metadata, or visualizations most relevant to your research.

??? task "Create a custom widget for ELN sections and custom tags"
    To create a custom widget for filtering your ELN, follow these steps:

    1. Click on the `+ TERMS` button to open the *Edit terms widget* menu.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/widget_step_1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Edit terms widget menu" width="800">
    </div>

    2. In the *Search quantity* field, type *eln*. A list of available filters will appear.

    3. Select `results.eln.sections` from the list. This will enable filtering based on the built-in ELN sections available in your ELN upload.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/widget_step_2_3.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting results.eln.sections filter" width="400">
    </div>

    4. Write a descriptive title for the custom widget in *Title field*.

    5. Click DONE!

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/widget_step_4_5.png" alt="Screenshot of finalizing the custom widget" width="400">
    </div>

    The new ELN sections widget now appears at the top of your **EXPLORE** page and displays ELN entry types along with their corresponding counts.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/widget_step_5r.png" alt="Screenshot of the newly created ELN sections widget" width="400">
    </div>

    You can now follow the same steps to create a custom widget for filtering by custom tags.

    In Step 3, instead of selecting `results.eln.sections`, choose `results.eln.tags`. This will create a widget that filters your ELN entries based on the custom tags you have assigned.

    This widget will then appear on your **EXPLORE** page, allowing you to quickly view and filter entries by their associated tags.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/organization/explore_you_ELN_entries.gif" alt="Animation of filtering using widgets" width="800">
